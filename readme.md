## Overview


## Domain Mapping

 - Each site has a primary domain, which may be a second level domain or a subdomain.
 - Subdomains could be supported.
 - If no site can be found, visitor is directed to network homepage.
 - Virtually all link functions reference "siteurl" and "home" options, we modify them once a request is validated.

 - The network's (WordPress calls it "site") domain setting in wp_sites is used in links but not served.
